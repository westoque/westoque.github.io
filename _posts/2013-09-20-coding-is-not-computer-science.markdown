Programming in college definitely taught me a lot of things. Mostly
about data structures and things we consider to be good and fast design.
I found them to be extremely useful when working on very "complex"
problems.

Although recently, I dedicated some time to teach some people how to
program. Most of them did not take Computer Science or take any
programming classes before so I thought it would be an interesting
experience. What I discovered was that it was easier for people to
understand the uses of the piece of code by explaining it to them
simply without the scientific bullshit.

For example, in Ruby, I would have an Array that I'll use as a Stack.
And going back to our data structures class, we know that we can *push*
and *pop* from this Stack. So instead of explaining how Stacks work,
we can just ask ourselves on what we wanted to do with our Array. Do
we want to put something in the start or end of it? Then, we figure out
what the method is by googling or looking at documentation. I've found
this to be the most effective method to get people to start building
things and not worry about the technicalities. Sometimes, technicalities
make things more complicated and also tends to scare people off.

Of course, this is not the path to becoming the next amazing developer
but through time, they will get exposed to more things that will lead
them to learn deeper topics, slowly.
